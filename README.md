## Access Control Service (ACS)

For more information about Access Control Services, please read the following documentation:

### LICENSE
This project is licensed under Apache v2.

### How to run ACS locally
To run the service locally, go to service/ directory

```
source ./service/start-acs-public.sh
```
The ACS service requires a UAA (User Account and Authentication: https://github.com/cloudfoundry/uaa) service to manage OAuth clients and users used in conjunction with ACS.
When running ACS locally, by default the service is configured to trust the local UAA. You can modify the environment variable `ACS_DEFAULT_ISSUER_ID` and `UAA_CHECK_HEALTH_URL` to correspond to your existing UAA.

### How to run UAA locally

Clone the UAA repository from the following url and checkout the 3.2.1 branch.

```
git clone https://github.com/cloudfoundry/uaa.git
cd uaa
git checkout releases/3.2.1
./gradlew assemble -x javadoc
./gradlew run -x javadoc --info
```

### Run ACS integration tests

The public profile starts UAA and ACS, runs the tests, then stops the ACS and UAA services.

```
source ./run-integration-tests.sh [-s <maven_settings_file>]
```
